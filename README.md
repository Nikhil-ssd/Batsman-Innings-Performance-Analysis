### Problem Statement

Analyze an IPL innings' batting performace of Andre Russel or Dinesh Karthik.

#### Dataset Information

I have manually created this dataset.

1️⃣ Went to (https://www.iplt20.com) to select an impactful innings of Dre Russ and checked the information in the scorecard.

3️⃣ Opened a copy of the IPL ball by ball dataset in Excel and filtered the data to see the ball by ball data only for Dre Russ's innings selected (70 from 31 vs PBKS on 1st Apr, 2022). 

4️⃣ Removed the columns not required and rows of balls which were wides, added a new column for phase based on the over and renamed the tab and saved it.

5️⃣ Added a new tab for the wagon wheel data obtained from the wagon wheel section of the match information page (https://lnkd.in/dmrDsvbY), added a new column for the Sector number and percentage of runs scored in each sector, renamed the tab and saved it.

### Purpose of Solving this problem

Analyzing a batsman’s specific IPL innings of 70 runs from 31 balls using detailed stats serves multiple purposes, offering insights into the player’s performance, strengths, and tactical decisions. Here’s an overview of its objectives:

#### 1. Performance Evaluation
Strike Rate (SR): Assess the pace of the innings and how it impacted the match context.
Boundary Impact: Analyze the proportion of runs scored via boundaries (fours and sixes) versus singles/doubles, indicating aggressive play.
Dot Ball Analysis: Measure how efficiently the batsman rotated the strike during the innings.

#### 2. Tactical Insights
Bowler-Specific Performance:
Examine which bowlers the batsman targeted successfully and which posed challenges.
Understand matchups (e.g., performance against spin vs. pace).
Phase-Wise Contribution:
Analyze runs scored during specific phases (Powerplay, Middle Overs, Death Overs) to assess adaptability to match situations.

#### 3. Decision-Making and Game Awareness
Risk Management: Determine how the batsman balanced aggressive shots with calculated risks in different match situations.
Adaptability: Study how the batsman adjusted to varying conditions, bowlers, and field placements during the innings.

#### 4. Skill Analysis
Shot Selection:
Use the wagon wheel to identify scoring zones, highlighting preferred areas for boundaries or scoring.
Understand technical proficiencies (e.g., strength on the off-side or against short-pitched deliveries).
Scoring Distribution:
Analyze whether the batsman predominantly relied on specific shots or showed versatility.

#### 5. Training and Improvement
Identifying Strengths:
Pinpoint strengths such as boundary-hitting zones, capability against particular types of bowlers, or high-pressure finishing skills.
Spotting Weaknesses:
Recognize areas of improvement, such as minimizing dot balls or performing better in weak scoring zones.

#### 6. Contextual Impact
Match Impact:
Assess how this innings influenced the match outcome (e.g., whether it was a match-winning knock).
Pressure Handling:
Evaluate performance under pressure situations, such as chasing a steep target or rescuing the team from an early collapse.

#### 7. Fan Engagement and Commentary
Highlight Reel:
Use insights to create engaging content, such as highlighting the best shots or key moments of the innings.
Storytelling:
Provide fans with a detailed breakdown of how the innings unfolded, creating excitement and admiration for the player.

#### 8. Statistical Comparison
Benchmarking:
Compare this innings to the batsman’s other performances or against peers in similar match scenarios.
Consistency Analysis:
Use data to evaluate whether the innings was an anomaly or part of a consistent pattern.

#### 9. Strategic Team Use
Role Optimization:
Analyze if the batsman is more effective in specific roles (e.g., finisher, anchor, powerplay hitter).
Opponent Preparation:
Help teams understand how the batsman approaches innings and prepare strategies to counteract him in future matches.
